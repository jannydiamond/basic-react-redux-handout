## React

$$
  react(state) = view
$$

* Library for view rendering
* Opensourced by Facebook in 2013
* Small API & “one way” data flow
* Relatively easy to understand & reason about
* Efficiently updates and renders the view when your data changes.
* Huge community & rich ecosystem
 
### JSX
* _HTML in JS_
* Syntactic sugar for function calls (`React.createElement()`)
  ```jsx
  const myMarkUp = (
      <div className="much wow">
        <h1>HTML in JS</h1>
      </div>
  );
  ```
